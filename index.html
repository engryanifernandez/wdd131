            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Yani's Profile Picture">
            <p>Hi, I'm Hazel Diane Fernandez, but you can call me Yani!
                I'm a licensed Civil Engineer living in Zambales, Philippines,
                with a passion for creating solutions that make a difference in my community.
                I currently work full-time at SBMA in Subic, where I contribute to various infrastructure projects.
                Alongside my engineering career, I'm pursuing a degree in Software Development at BYU-Idaho,
                driven by my love for technology and continuous learning.
                As a single mom to two amazing kids, Ashton and Hailey,
                I balance my professional life with being their biggest cheerleader.
                I'm also deeply involved in my church, serving as a Seminary teacher
                and a service missionary for BYU Pathway Worldwide.
                When I'm not working or studying, you'll probably find me playing the piano,
                guitar, or catching up on some favorite TV shows with my fianc√©, Caleb.</p>

            <p>The Philippines is an archipelago of over 7,000 islands located in Southeast Asia,
                bordered by the Pacific Ocean. It is renowned for its rich biodiversity,
                being home to about 5% of the world's flora and fauna,
                with a significant number of species endemic to the country.
                The Philippines is famous for its stunning beaches, vibrant coral reefs,
                and its unique wildlife, including the Philippine eagle, tarsiers,
                and its vast variety of tropical fruits.
                It is also a global leader in coconut production and is known for its beautiful landscapes,
                from the Banaue Rice Terraces to the Chocolate Hills.</p>
