            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Hazel Diane Fernandez, but you can call me Yani!
                I'm a licensed Civil Engineer living in Zambales, Philippines, 
                with a passion for creating solutions that make a difference in my community. 
                I currently work full-time at SBMA in Subic, where I contribute to various infrastructure projects. 
                Alongside my engineering career, I'm pursuing a degree in Software Development at BYU-Idaho, 
                driven by my love for technology and continuous learning.
                As a single mom to two amazing kids, Ashton and Hailey, 
                I balance my professional life with being their biggest cheerleader. 
                I'm also deeply involved in my church, serving as a Seminary teacher 
                and a service missionary for BYU Pathway Worldwide. 
                When I'm not working or studying, you'll probably find me playing the piano, 
                guitar, or catching up on some favorite TV shows with my fianc√©, Caleb.</p>
